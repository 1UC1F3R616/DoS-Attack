# DoS-Attack
Use on your own system, I am not responsible for any illegal use. Modify on your own risk.

:camel: I tested it on my website, and some other websites that I shall not be telling here. Results were satisfactory, With Good Internet Connect it can easily take down any GitHub.io website if you do DDoS attack then it will give more better results as expected.
